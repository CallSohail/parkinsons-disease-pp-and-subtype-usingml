Overview
This project, Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction, leverages machine learning models to identify subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) and predict disease progression. Using comprehensive clinical and genetic data, we aim to support personalized treatment approaches, optimized clinical trials, and patient management.

Objectives
Identify PD Subtypes: Classify patients into progression rates (slow, moderate, and fast progressors).
Develop Predictive Models: Train models to forecast disease course, using baseline clinical factors, biomarkers, and genetic data.
Utilize Machine Learning Techniques: Employ supervised and unsupervised learning models to analyze PD data effectively.

Usage
Data Input: Use either provided sample datasets or upload new patient data.
Subtype Prediction: Explore PD subtypes and view patient progression predictions with probability distributions.
Feature Importance: Visualize feature impact using SHAP values for insights into model predictions.
Model Architecture
The project uses both supervised and unsupervised learning models:

Unsupervised Learning: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to represent progression space, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for clustering subtypes.
Supervised Learning: Ensemble models using XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest to predict disease progression and subtype classification.
Results
The predictive models demonstrate high accuracy:

Subtype Classification: The models can accurately distinguish PD progression rates, achieving an AUC of 0.92 on baseline factors.
Cross-validation: Validation on independent datasets such as the PDBP cohort shows consistent predictive accuracy.
